# Personal website for introduce yourself

## Getting Started

I have developed this theme as a personal project. I have taken the inspiration (and basically all the design) from the wonderful work of Britanny Chiang. You can visit her repo [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)

Because I'm not a ReactJS expert (Britanny's project language framework), and I liked so her design, I decided to develop this project with Angular's architecture. The website is not connected to any api yet, neither does it have dynamic content, so that all the content is static inside the HTML files in Angular. I want to connect it to an API in the future, from where I can manage it in an easy way without having to touch the HTML files in Angular.

If you have any ideas or you just want to contribute in this repo in order to improve the development architecture, I invite you to do it! If you have some suggestion for me, I will be glade to receive it

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm and Angular CLI installed in your pc. Npm is available with NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/es/). After you install npm, install Angular CLI by typing the following command in your terminal

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Just clone  the repo and execute the following command inside the folder project

``` bash
npm install
```

### All done!!

Now just run
```
npm start
```
Wait to compile and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) after compile finish

### Wait! I does not have finished yet!

I want to quote what Brittanty has added in her project:

>Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.
I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

As I have made an attribution to Brittany, I will be waiting for you do the same with this project. Thank you :)
